# Geodesy

This is a copy of Mike Gavaghan's [Geodesy][0] library, used without
permission.  This was a clone of ndimiduk's github, but rearranged the directory
structure to use the maven build paths.

Also, I'm also updated to use gradle to build the project.

Gradle can also be used to create the projects for intellij

./gradlew idea

And also the project for eclipse

./gradlew eclipse


The jar can be build just by running gradlew in the root directory.

./gradlew
